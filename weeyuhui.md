I am a CNYang student currently on an overseas exchange in Sweden. I enjoy snacking and playing cookie run in my free time. I also code in my free time and I believe that Python is better than R.  

I am currently involved in a network alignment project to find a gold standard for network alignment algorithms and testing current existing networks programs if they are able to meet that criteria.
